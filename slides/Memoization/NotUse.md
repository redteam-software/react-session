### When not to use

- **Lightweight Functions**
<br/>If a function or calculation is fast and doesnâ€™t impact performance, memoization may add unnecessary complexity.


- **High Memory Usage**
<br/>Caching a lot of results may increase memory usage, so memoization should be used thoughtfully, especially in memory-limited environments.
